As part of one of the excursions during my bootcamp at IOC (Institute of Code), I had the opportunity to  visit the Tegalalang rice paddies and what a beautiful sight it was! You can walk through the rice fields and they have the cutest swing (You can find a pic of me on the swing on my insta profile) which alot of people queue up to use for those fab insta shots. Its a bloggers/photographers paradise!
